# Snakes and Ladders

A JavaScript-based computer game I built to deepen my knowledge and enhance my programming skills

## What is Snakes and Ladders?

Play the classic Snakes and Ladders game, now adapted for the computer screen. This two-player game pits red against yellow. Click the 'Roll Dice' button to generate a random number between 1 and 6, determining your points and advancing your token on the board. Land on a square with the bottom of a ladder to climb to the top. Beware of the snakesâ€”land on a snake's head, and you'll slide down to the bottom of the ladder. Be the first player to collect exactly 100 points to reach the end of the board and win

## What I learned by building this project?

I developed dynamic page content by leveraging for loops to render div elements, with specific logic to conditionally appent class-tagged paragraphs for board piece creation. I also learned to to utilize conditional statments and appendChild to refind the output. Additionally, I implemented transform and a switch statement to code a functional rolling dice feature.
